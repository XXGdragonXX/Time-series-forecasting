# Time-series-forecasting

We are forecasting the sale for each brand for the month of april 2025 based on the sale of last 3 months

1. Kaggle dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devarajv88/walmart-sales-dataset/data

STEP 1 

1. The above dataset doesnt have a date column so we will be adding a date column
2. Create a my sql server and  upload the dataset with table name as 'purchase_data'
3. run the query in the file add_date.sql 

STEP 2 
1. Now we need to do some data preprocessing and wrangling
2. Run the entire query present in create_data.sql
3. Extract the table as a csv or if you can create a connnector and directly connect , thats even better

STEP 3
